I think we can solve by
1) I declare a function
2) I create a for loop through an array that comes as an parameter to the function
3) That loop will do the following:
    0) I declare a count variable with 0 as value
    a) It will loop through each value of the array
    b) The first index value is compared with the next index values checking their difference to see in what order they are
    c) The value of the comparison determines the order direction
    b) That value determines if we have to swap the position of the values compared in the array or not
    e) If positions are swapped, count +=1
    f) After that value is checked, if count = 0, break and return array. If count != 0, we repeat all steps from 0 to e on the next index position
